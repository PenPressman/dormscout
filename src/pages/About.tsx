                  I'm about to start my freshman year at Harvard, and honestly, the thing I stressed about the most wasn't classesâ€¦it was my dorm. I kept wondering: what's it gonna look like? how big is it? what do people usually do with the space?
                </p>
                
                <p className="mb-4">
                  There wasn't really a good way to find out. I could figure out what the building looked like, but not the room. I don't know the ins and outs of living there. So, I decided to build a solution.
                </p>
                
                <p className="mb-4">
                  That's how Dorm Scout was born. Students can post their actual dorm rooms so future students can see what they're walking into, get ideas, and feel a little less nervous about move-in.

                  The site's up and running, but here's the catch: I need your help to get it started. If you're in college, do me (and the next class of freshmen) a huge favor â€” post your room. Share your setup, your hacks, and anything else you learned.
                </p>
                
                <p className="mb-4">
                  Think of it like passing the torch. Your pics could save someone hours of stress, and you get dorm clout along the way.
